Sorry to have you here in the first place. I won't go deep in this. But, I just saw how easily this app made me write an apology. There are many stuffs you can do with it starting with yeah writing a long boring letter to your friend no matter what your mood is and letting them know how dodgy you feel.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, share them is this page to make their day as your letters are always on the first page and if not, copying the URL and sending it to your friends will give them a cozy vibe and may set their mood free, god knows.</p><p><br></p><p>Techies, this does not have a FAANG like load balancer, please don't break my site downðŸ¥º, You know what i mean.</p>",

Youâ€™re going to have to just roll with the flow, take it in, glean lessons from it, and then carry on, head held high. Maybe journal on itâ€”sometimes insights donâ€™t come quick, but thereâ€™s something <em><u>positive</u></em> to be found from most experiences in life. Focus on that.</blockquote>",
